### Description
This course offers an opportunity to work on independent projects involving the development and/or application of geographic information systems (GIS).

The course is organized as a seminar: a series of weekly meetings and concurrent assignments that ultimately
lead to the implementation and presentation of student-initiated projects. Early in the semester, each student
selects a term project dealing with one particular topic in the field of GIS, broadly defined. Topics may range
from the basic development of geospatial tools and techniques to practical applications in any of a variety of
fields.

Class time will be a combination of structured collaboration, external speakers, and (possibly) lectures on relevant content.

### Course Resources
The course's GitHub repo will be the source of truth for the course.  
https://github.com/CPLN-680-Spring-2022/Class-Resources  

However, I've also created a Canvas page for email announcements and collection of assignments (if necessary).


### Project Description
The requirements for the final project are intentionally broad, as students are expected to develop one that suits their interests.

Possible project formats include:  
- A research paper with GIS analysis about a substantive question.  
- A research paper about GIS or spatial methodology.  
- Construction of a GIS tool.  
- A dashboard *answering a question*. (The dashboard cannot simply be a view of the data. It must be targeted towards a novel question.)

For all projects, a complete set of data, scripts, and reports must be provided via GitHub or Google Drive. This should include the raw data, and all processing and analysis.

Students will present on their projects in the final two sessions of the class.

### Assignments

Assignments must be submitted by the time the class meets. 
The first two assignments can be submitted on Canvas or by email. 
Subsequent assignments should be uploaded to GitHub.  

**01-14 Initial Topic Brainstorm**: One-page (or less) document summarizing  
- your topic  
- an open question in the topic to research  
- format of your final deliverable  
- possible data sources  
*These will be considered non-binding proposals. The goal is to get you to start brainstorming.*

**01-21 Project Proposal 0**: Two-page (or less) document with   
- the question you will be answering  
- datasets identified  
- (brief) summary of existing relevant research   
- high-level summary of methods and outputs  

**01-28 GitHub Repo**: Share a GitHub repo for your project, with  
- Raw data in a `raw_data/` directory.  
- Any scripts, files, or cleaned data.  
- A README file in the top directory.  

**02-04 Data Summary Analysis**: An exploratory descriptive analysis of your dataset(s). Include summary statistics and visualizations that speak to your research question. All relevant code and files should be in your GitHub repo.

**02-11 Project Proposal 1**: An update of Project Proposal 0, with motivating data summary. This may just be a concatenated version of your Proposal 0 and Data Analysis, but your question and deliverable may have changed.

**02-25 Work in Progress Report**: A draft of your project, to be reviewed by two peers. Provide as much analysis as you can, to be able to get proper feedback.

Should include  
- Introduction and motivation.
- Literature review.  
- Initial analysis and/or technical implementation.  

*These will be presented as Mid-Point Presentations (10 min + 5 min Q&A).*

**03-04 Peer Feedback**: Peer review of two projects. Review goals include: Project design, implementation review, extension ideas.

**03-25 Code Review**: Code/implementation review of one peer project. We will discuss this in class.

**04-29 (TBD) Final Project**
