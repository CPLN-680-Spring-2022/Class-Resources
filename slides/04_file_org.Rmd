## Agenda

- Better Engineering: File Organization
- *10 minute break*
- Proposal and Data Presentations

---

## Better Engineering?

Code is for *humans*.

Good code:

- Is easy to understand and navigate.
- Is obvious how to extend.
- Minimizes time needed to make a change.
- Minimizes opportunity for mistakes.

---

## Today: Data Cleaning and File Organization

Inspired by:

- [Code and Data for Social Sciences, Gentzkow & Shapiro](https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/CodeAndData.pdf)
- Clean Code, Martin

## What can go wrong? (from Gentzkow & Shapiro)

## What is the answer?

Not working harder. Working smarter.

## Rules for Data Analysis

**Rule 1: Modularity.** Separate your workflow into steps. Each step gets its own script(s). Save outputs in between.

---

## My original workflow

1. Download raw data
2. Clean it by hand
3. Gigantic script that reshaped the data, ran analysis, generated plots.
    a. Hard-coded assumptions hidden everywhere including settings, file locations, dates. 
    a. This would often break. Only way to check was post-hoc, or error debugging.
4. Write report by hand. Copy numbers from printed output.

---

## What does this mean?

- If something needs to change...
  1. Only I can do it.
  1. There are five different places that need to change. I will forget some of them.
  1. It takes a long time.
  1. Very high probability of breaking something or (worse) introducing correctness error.

## What is the answer?

**Modularity**

Also known as "Separation of Concerns" or "Single Responsibility Principle".

*"Separate an application into steps, with minimal overlapping functions between them and clear deliverables in between."*


---

## Modularity of data analysis

1. Download raw data.
1. Clean the data.
1. Conduct analysis.
1. Produce plots and tables.
1. Create report.

These should be separate scripts that save results. The next script only depends on the saved outputs of the last one.

---

## Why does this help?

Suppose you get next year's raw data, but the format has changed. 

All you need to do is munge the data to the same format as the last clean output!

This format means

a. The expectations are clear.
a. You won't accidentally mix in assumptions later on.

---

## A note

None of this is language specific, or even specific to coding.

---

## Rules for Data Analysis

**Rule 2: Automation.** Automate everything that can be automated.

---

## Why automate?

1. Reproducible
1. Auditable
1. Reduces human error


---

## Non-obvious things to automate

1. Manually fixing data errors.
1. Copying files between locations.
1. Copying text from an output to a report.
1. Running scripts in the right order.

Ask yourself: "As I work through this, what is manual? How many clicks are required?"

---

## Raw Data

**Rule 2a**: Keep your raw data in a separate file. You *never* modify this directly.

---

## Confident Automation

Produce plots and outputs that make you confident in the results.

- Counts of data.
- Means and distributions.
- Maps and summary plots.
- (Eventually) Unit tests.

What do you look at when something goes wrong? Automate that!

---


## Zooming out

Don't be overwhelmed! Do better than yesterday. Your future self will thank you.

---

## Zooming out

There will always be human interaction needed. But ask yourself, what's the current bottleneck of my time? The current riskiest part if someone else tried to run this?


---

## And now...

**Live Demo!**


--- 
## Presentations

- A 7 minute presentation (with 3 min questions).
- Include 
    - Your question.
    - Your data sources.
    - Descriptive statistics, plots and/or maps of your variables.
    - Open question and most important next steps.

Viewers: Please help them make progress!

- Is the question clear, answerable, and implicating?
- What risks do you see in the next steps? What should be de-risked?
- What's one thing that is well done, and one area of growth?

---

## Presentations

* 10 minute break.
* Presentations for 1 hour.
* See you back here at XX:XX

- Group A: Here
- Group B: Room 323

## Presentation Debrief

1. What did you learn from someone else's presentation?
1. What good feedback did you get?
1. What are your next open questions?
1. Any common themes across projects?

## Next week

1. Presentation from Seth Bluestein and Michelle Montalvo!
1. Second batch of presentations.
