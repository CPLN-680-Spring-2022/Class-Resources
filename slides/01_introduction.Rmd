## The Capstone Project
The final project is an...

- independent study
- on a substantive question
- using GIS data

*I'm here to help, but ultimately you are responsible for driving and executing your project.*

--- 

## Possible project deliverables

* Research paper on a topical question
* Research paper on GIS methodology
* Dashboard*
* GIS tool

---

## Examples from past years

* Spatial analysis of food safety violations in Philadelphia
* Spatial methods for heritage preservation
* Latitudinal shifts of grass plant functional types
* Evaluating two-seat rides for SEPTA

## Project components

* Final deliverable.
* Presentation to the class.
* Complete GitHub repository* with raw data, processed data, outputs.

*This is my first time using GitHub to teach, so will be flexible.*

## Course time

* Working groups on projects
* Student presentations
* External speakers, "Anatomy of a project"
* Lectures on Spatial Methods, Better Engineering for Researchers

## A note on technical requirements

My approach to programming is practical. 

- You only ever need "good enough," and there will always be someone more expert.
- You will see enormous gains (errors, iteration speed) by improving your engineering 20%.
- Push yourself in reasonable directions for final project.
- The most important thing is to overcome 0 $\rightarrow$ 1, teach you how to learn for yourself.

---

## A survey

Do you plan on using... 

- ESRI
- R
- Python
- Something else

---

## A survey

What is your familiarity with...  

- Git & GitHub
- Command line
- Spatial Econometric methodologies (e.g. "autoregression")

What other GIS topics would you like to learn?

---

## A survey

How confident are you in your idea for project?  

1 - Not confident at all.  
5 - I know exactly what I want to do.

## A note on the calendar

The calendar is aggressive at the beginning to discover blockers.

*NOTE: This is the first time I'm teaching this course, so what follows may be tweaked based on how things go. I promise one week's notice before any changes.*
